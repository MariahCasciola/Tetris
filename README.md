### I grew up playing an LCD tetris game for hours, and got quite good at it until my BRATZ FIT IT! got lost in the shuffle of my five generations of stuffed animals

### I got inspired to learn how to make a game in canvas, so here is my attempt
### The commands for this game are WASD, W will rotate the one tetromino block, "orangeRicky" clockwise

## This game has not been made with moblie in mind, real gamers play games on pcs and consoles

### I am using this project to learn about DOM manipulation, canvas, and to go deeper into CSS
